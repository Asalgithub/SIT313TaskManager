Task Management Application

# Problem Statement
Students are quite busy with work, studies and other social activities
There are many tasks to do for students and it is easy to forget some of the task
People usually have a notebook
With modern technology, it should be easier to manage tasks
There are some applications in the market which are too complex
I would like to create an Android Application to solve this problem

# Features in application
Similar to “Google Keep”

View action items (First, Last, Next, Previous)
Mark action items as done
Mark action items as undone
